# Oracle 23ai JSON Relational Duality

JSON Relational Duality is a new capability in Oracle Database 23ai that unifies the benefits of both the relational and document models.

Until now, developers have had to use either the relational model or the JSON document model, to both store and access application data. Therefore, they had to make a choice that involved acquiring the benefits as well as the drawbacks of the model they selected:

The relational data model is ideal as a storage format due to the power of normalization, which eliminates data duplication and provides consistency and efficiency. However, the relational model is not as ideal as an access format for building applications since applications process data in terms of hierarchical objects. 

The document model, such as JSON, is ideal as an access format since it is hierarchical and self-contained, making it easy to map to application objects. However, JSON documents are poor as a storage format since different documents can repeat the same data, resulting in data duplication, updates to multiple copies, and, therefore, potential inconsistenciesâ€”the very problem that the relational model solves via normalization.

JSON Relational Duality is a breakthrough innovation that overcomes the historical challenges developers have faced when choosing between a relational model or a document model for building applications. Developers can now get the flexibility and data access simplicity of the document model as well as the efficiency, consistency, and use case flexibility of the relational model on the same underlying data.
